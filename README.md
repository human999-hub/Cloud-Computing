All the projects and documents related to my work in cloud computing

1. Cloud Adoption Strategy for a company
Analyzed the current cloud architecture of a company and created a cloud adoption plan to improve efficiency in the usage of cloud resources as a final project for the cloud computing course.

2. Advanced Deployment of Web-based Bookstore Application on AWS
Deployed a full-stack web-based bookstore application using React (frontend), JSP/Servlet (backend), and MySQL on AWS within a VPC architecture, implementing advanced deployment with a public subnet (web server), private subnet (database server), NAT gateway, and security groups to ensure secure and scalable accessibility.

3. Top 20 Hashtags Counter using PySpark and Amazon EMR
Developed a distributed data processing pipeline to analyze Twitter JSON data and identify the top 20 hashtags using PySpark on Amazon EMR. Implemented a mapper-reducer approach for efficient hashtag extraction and counting, leveraging Apache Sparkâ€™s RDDs for scalability. Deployed the solution on a transient EMR cluster with output stored in AWS S3. Successfully processed large datasets, optimized resource usage, and ensured accurate hashtag frequency ranking.

4. REST API Implementation using AWS Lambda
Developed a serverless backend with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and RDS, implementing secure REST APIs for CRUD operations while resolving region-specific IAM challenges and ensuring seamless database integration.
